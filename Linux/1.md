# Linux V/S Unix

Unix ko dekh ke Linux bana tha

| Linux | Unix |
| ----- | ---- |
| available to everyone | only used by copyrighters |
| Free | Varying costs |
| just a kernal | complete package |

hardwar -> Kernel -> Shell -> Applications

## Interface

CLI (Command - line interface)
</br>
Jaha pe commands de ke computer ko instructions dete hain (OS)

GUI (Graphical user interface)
Windows has CLI as well but majorly uses GUI


## Linux Architecture

- Kernel

``` 
Monolithic kernel
kernel that integrates all operating system services into a single program. All components run in a single address space
Process Management handles process creation, scheduling and termination maintains a process table.
```

- Windows

```
Hybrid(Monolytic &amp; Microkernel)
integrates GUI
Propietry
```

- Linux

```
Monolythic
Seperates GUI
open source
```

## Full Form

- BIOS : Basic Input/Output System
- UEFI : Unified Extensible Firmfare Interface
- GRUB : Grand Unified Bootlander

## Linux V/S Windows

| Linux | Windows |
| ----- | ------- |
| Open source | Not |
| Free | Costly |
| Case sensitive | Case Insensitive |
| More efficient | Less |
| / is used to seperate directories | \ |
| More Secure | Less |
| 3 types of user accounts | 4 |
| Regular , Root , Service Account | Administrator , Standard , Child , Guest |
| Root user is super user and has all admin priviliges | Administrator |

## Users in Linux

- Regular : Home directory yeah just apni apni home directory mein hi dekh skte unless they have  given permission
dollar sign means regular user

- Root User : yeah sabki files dekh skta hai {Full Access} also known as superuser
sudo apt-get update : list of softwares ko update kr dega
sudo apt-get upgrade : Actual mein install krdega updated softwares ko


- Service User : Apna hi account hoga

## Basic Commands

- *ls*

```

list all files and directories of the working directory (CHILDREN)
/ is root node
```

- pwd

```
present working directory (PARENT)
```

- cd bin

```
Relative path
with slash absolute path
cd .. se back jaoge
```

- mkdir dir_name

```
makes directory 
```

- touch 1.txt

```
Blank file create
```

- mv 1.txt dir_name

```
1.txt moved to dir_name folder
```

- cp 2.txt dir_name

```
2.txt is copied in dir_name folder
```

- root file ke andar changes nahi kr skte

- ls -R    ```(Tree-like Format)```

``` 
directories aur uske subdirectories ke content ko bhi dikha dega
```

- ls -a

```
Shows hidden file as well
touch command create hidden files first
```

- ls -lart

```
lists all the directories in a list format along with the time of last modification, read and write permissions, permitted user
```

- history

```
Shows history of all commands
```

- echo harry

```
harry print ho jaega
```

- printf "HI"

```
prints HI
```

- ls -l ```(Long list of all files)```

```
users -> group -> others
d means directory 
- means file
chmod changes the file mode (changes permissions of files/directories)
chmod 734 file.txt 
734 is mode
```

- ps

```
all running process shown
```

- ps -a

```
all background processes are shown as well
```

- top

```
sabse jada resources vale process show krega
```

- kill PI (process id)

```
kill kr dega us process ko
```

- sudo su 

```
dollar gets converted to #
regular -> pseudo user
ls vim harr.txt   -> opens vim editor
```

- init

```
Initializes the system and starting up other system processes
```

- Swap Space

```
Portion of hard disk or SSD used as VIRTUAL MEMORY in OS when physical RAM is fully utilized.
```

- swapon -s

```
Check swap space
```

- mkswap

```
to setup swap file
```

- swapon

```
enable swap
```

- dd is used to create swap space (empty file)

- fdisk -l

```
for list partitions
```

- fdisk

```
interactively create, delete and manage partitions
```

- df -h

```
display information about disk space usage
```

- ls -r

```
displays in reverse order
```

- ls -d

```
List directories not contents
```

- ls -i

```
index number of each file
```

- ls more OR ls -1

```
content line by line
```

- ls -t

```
sorts files by modification time
```

- ls -h

```
Provides human readable form
```

- ls -R

```
List all files & directories recursively including subdirectories
```

- -s

```
Sorts files by access time
```

- ls -G

```
inhibits the display of group info.
```

- mkdir -m mode dir_name

```
Sets file permission mode of the created directory
```

- mkdir -p path

```
Create parent directories if they do not exist
```

- mkdir -v dir1 dir2

```
Print a message for each directory
```

- rmdir

```
Remove directories
```

- rmdir dir1/dir2/dir3

```
Remove dir3 but dir1 & dir2 should be there
```

- rmdir -v dir1 dir2

```
Outputs a diagnostic message for each processed directory
```

- User account info.

```
/etc/passwd
encrypted passwords of users - /etc/shadow/
info about group : /etc/group
system wide shell config. file : /etc/profile
```

- cd ~

```
change the working directory to your home directory
```

- -p

```
Path of directories
```

- free -b

```
info in bytes
```

- free -m

```
Info in megabytes
```

- free -g

```
info in gigabytes

free -t adds additional line in output showing col. totals
```

- cat > file_name

```
- tac file_name

```
display content in reverse order
```

- cat >> file.txt

```
write in an already existing file. 
```

```
4 line file1 is diff from line 5 file2

4a5 > Anamika
 after the line 4 of the first file, you need to add the line Anamika to match line 5 of the second file 1.
```

## Kernel

core of LINUX
</br>
responsible for managing hardware , running processes and providing system services.

## Free

gives info about used and unused memory.
by default it displays in kilobytes
memory mainly consists of RAM and swap memory
swap memory part of hard disk drive that acts like virtual RAM

## df is disk free

shows the amount of space taken up by diff. drives
by default -> 1-kilobytes blocks

## du is disk usage

Bg is block size in gb
Bm is block size in mb

## fdisk

-l : list the partition table

-n : Creates a new partition

-d : Deletes the partition

-p : prints the partition table

-u : changes the display units to sectors

-v : shows the versions of fdisk commands

## Linux

Handle I/O devices

Kernel modules : Handle device drivers and hardware interaction

Init in linux kernel architecture : Bootstrapping the system and starting user-level processes

BootLoader : Loading the kernel into memory from disk
GRUB : loading Linux Kernel into memory


## Disk Partioning

dividing physical disk into multiple local storage units called partitions to organize data and manage partitions

## File System Structure

- / (root directory)

- /bin (binary)

```
cat,ls,cp
ps,ls,ping,grep
```

- /sbin (System / Super User Binaries)

- /boot

```
Contains files necessary for the boot process such as kernel
```

- /usr 

```
Storing system binaries and essential programs.
```

- /var

```
Temporary storage
```

- /var/log/

```
Storing log files
```

- /dev

```
Device files representing hardware devices
```

- /tmp

```
Storing temporary files and directories
```

- /mnt

```
Mounting Temporary filesystems
```

- /opt

```
stores software packages and libraries for optional software
```
