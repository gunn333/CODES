function which will be called when we create object
same name as class
TYPES:
        default constructor no arguments passed
        parameterized Constructor with arguments
        copy constructor initialize by another existing object

                     *Destructor*
called while deleting objects
cannot pass any parameters
~class_name()     ----> Name of Destructor



                    *Encapsulation*
Methods and variables bind together in a single unit (capsule)(class)
only accessible from class methods
leads to data abstraction and data hiding

                    *Abstraction*
Only essential data display krega

                    *Inheritance*
ek class dusri class se properties inherit kregi

                    *Access Specifiers*

public
private    only accessible in their own class
protected  accessible in own class , parent class and derived class



--> Array fixed size sequential data of same type
--> Array has contiguous mery locations
--> Array size must be integer constant that is greater than 1
--> Main() cannot have parameters
--> Virtual type function_name() = value;
--> Pointer store memory address
--> Function Prototype used for function declaration
--> new keyword is used for dynamic memory allocation
--> recursion is a function that calls itself
--> Class is blueprint of objects
--> Constructor is member function of a class
--> new is used to allocate memory for an object
--> Lambda function anonymous function that can capture variables from its surrounding scope
--> Typeid check if a variable is of a specific type
--> Virtual function declared as virtual in base class and can be overridden in derived class
--> References are automatically dereferenced, while pointers require explicit dereferencing.
--> Break to exit loop or switch statement prematurely
--> Continue skip the rest of the code in a loop  iteration and move to the next iteration
--> Pointer address access ke liye - & value - *
--> Static specify that a variable is shared among  all instances of a class
--> Order of destruction - parent to child class
--> Template class that can be instantiated with different data types
--> nothrow keyword - memory allpcate and return null pointer on failure
--> const_cast - cast constant object to a non constant object
--> default case : provide default value when no value matches
--> program execution time memory allocate - Dynamic memory allocation
--> static_cast : cast b/w  unrelated data types
--> friend function : function that can access private and protected members of a class
--> std::move -  move the content of one object to 
another efficiently
--> object - instance of a class
--> getter and setter encapsulationt d
